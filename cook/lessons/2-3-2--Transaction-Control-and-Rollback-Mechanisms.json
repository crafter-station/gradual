Transactions are a sequence of SQL operations that are executed as a single unit, ensuring that either all operations succeed (using COMMIT) or none do (using ROLLBACK), hence preserving data integrity. This concept is part of the ACID principles which include Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\n\nKey Points:\n- **COMMIT:** Finalizes a transaction, making all changes permanent.\n- **ROLLBACK:** Reverts the transaction if an error or interruption occurs."
