Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s. Their work was heavily influenced by the relational model proposed by Edgar F. Codd. The first iteration of this language was originally named SEQUEL, which stood for Structured English Query Language. It was specifically designed to facilitate the manipulation and retrieval of data within IBM's pioneering quasirelational database management system known as System R. This system was developed by a dedicated team at the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory during the 1970s.\\n\\nThe evolution of SQL from SEQUEL to its current form reflects significant advancements in database technology and the growing need for efficient data management solutions. The language was tailored to meet the requirements of users seeking a more intuitive way to interact with databases, ultimately leading to its widespread adoption across various platforms and systems.</chunk>\\n<chunk>Chamberlin and Boyce's initial foray into creating a relational database language was marked by the development of SQUARE (Specifying Queries in A Relational Environment). However, this early attempt faced usability challenges due to its reliance on subscript and superscript notation, which complicated the user experience. In 1973, after relocating to the San Jose Research Laboratory, they embarked on a new project intended as a successor to SQUARE. The original name, SEQUEL, was playfully derived as a pun on QUEL, the query language used by Ingres. However, the name was later modified to SQL (Structured Query Language) after it was discovered that \\\"SEQUEL\\\" was a trademark owned by the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company.\\n\\nFollowing the development of SQL, IBM conducted extensive testing at customer sites to evaluate the language's practicality and effectiveness. This led to the creation of commercial products based on their System R prototype, which included notable systems such as System/38, SQL/DS, and IBM Db2. These products were released to the market in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively, marking significant milestones in the commercial adoption of SQL and relational database technology.</chunk>\\n<chunk>The document provides a comprehensive overview of SQL (Structured Query Language), a pivotal programming language for relational databases that was developed in the 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. It traces SQL's evolution from its initial release in 1986 to the most recent version, SQL:2023, emphasizing the various dialects that have emerged and its significant influence on other query languages.\\n\\nKey aspects of SQL's structure are discussed, including its sublanguages: Data Query Language (DQL), Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Control Language (DCL), and Data Manipulation Language (DML). The document highlights SQL's foundation in relational algebra, which underpins its functionality and design.\\n\\nThe standardization of SQL by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is also covered, along with the challenges of ensuring compliance across different implementations. Criticisms regarding SQL's divergence from the relational model are addressed, providing a balanced view of its strengths and limitations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the document delves into SQL's data types and key components, as well as the integration of procedural programming features that enhance its capabilities.

Continue alternating between tutorials, examples, and questions\\n\\nRequired step count: 10-15 steps total\\n\\nExample pattern of steps:\\nTUTORIAL (introduce foundational concept)\\nEXAMPLE (demonstrate foundational concept)\\nQUESTION (test foundational concept)\\nQUESTION (reinforce foundational concept)\\nTUTORIAL (introduce intermediate concept)\\nEXAMPLE (demonstrate intermediate concept)\\nQUESTION (test intermediate concept)\\nQUESTION (reinforce intermediate concept)\\nEXAMPLE (demonstrate advanced application)\\nQUESTION (test advanced application)\\nTUTORIAL (deeper concept)\\nQUESTION (comprehensive application)\\n... continues\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n- Use markdown formatting in the content\\n- Make the progression logical and build upon previous knowledge\\n- Include code examples when relevant\\n- For questions, provide meaningful explanations for each alternative\\n- Stay focused on the specific topic scope\\n- Avoid covering material from other modules\\n\\nEach step must follow one of these formats:\\n\\nTUTORIAL steps should:\\n- Start with foundational concepts\\n- Use clear explanations with markdown formatting\\n- Include relevant code snippets or diagrams when needed\\n- Break down complex topics into digestible parts\\n- Format content as:\\n  {\\n    type: \\\"TUTORIAL\\\",\\n    title: \\\"Clear, concise title\\\",\\n    body: \\\"Detailed explanation in markdown\\\"\\n  }\\n\\nEXAMPLE steps should:\\n- Demonstrate practical applications\\n- Show real-world scenarios\\n- Include both the problem and its solution\\n- Explain the reasoning behind the solution\\n- Format content as:\\n  {\\n    type: \\\"EXAMPLE\\\",\\n    body: \\\"Problem description\\\",\\n    answer: \\\"Detailed solution\\\"\\n  }\\n\\nQUESTION steps should:\\n- Test understanding of previously covered concepts\\n- Have 3-4 carefully crafted alternatives\\n- Include detailed explanations for each alternative\\n- Ensure the correct alternative is clearly superior\\n- Format content as:\\n  {\\n    type: \\\"QUESTION\\\",\\n    question: \\\"Clear question text\\\",\\n    alternatives: [\\n      {\\n        order: 1,\\n        content: \\\"Alternative text\\\",\\n        explanation: \\\"Why this is/isn't correct\\\"\\n      },\\n      // ... more alternatives\\n    ],\\n    correctAlternativeOrder: number\\n  }\\n\\n<reminder>\\n  <topic-scope>\\n    Focus only on the current topic.
