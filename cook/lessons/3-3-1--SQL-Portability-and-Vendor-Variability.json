Key areas of divergence include the syntax for date and time, string concatenation methods, handling of `NULL` values, and the case sensitivity of comparisons. For instance, while both PostgreSQL and Mimer SQL aim for compliance with SQL standards, PostgreSQL does not consistently follow the standard in all aspects. A notable example is its treatment of unquoted identifiers; PostgreSQL converts them to lower case, contrary to the SQL standard, which dictates that unquoted names should be converted to upper case. Therefore, according to the standard, the identifiers `Foo` and `FOO` should be treated as equivalent, while PostgreSQL interprets `Foo` as distinct from `FOO` and `foo`.\\n\\nThis lack of uniformity in SQL implementations can lead to challenges in code portability between different database systems. As a result, developers often need to modify SQL code to accommodate the specific syntax and behavior of the target database management system (DBMS). The complexity and breadth of the SQL standard contribute to this issue, as many implementers choose not to support the entire standard. Additionally, the SQL standard does not provide explicit guidelines for certain critical areas, such as indexing and file storage, leaving it to individual implementations to determine their behavior. This further exacerbates the inconsistencies observed across various SQL platforms.</chunk>\\n<chunk>Popular SQL implementations often lack support for fundamental features outlined in the Standard SQL specification, particularly concerning the `DATE` and `TIME` data types. Notable examples include Oracle Database, where the `DATE` type functions similarly to `DATETIME` and does not include a distinct `TIME` type, and Microsoft SQL Server, which also omitted a dedicated `TIME` type until the 2008 version. Consequently, SQL code is frequently not portable across different database systems without necessitating modifications.\\n\\n### Reasons for Incompatibility\\n\\nThe lack of portability between various SQL database management systems (DBMS) can be attributed to several factors:\\n\\n- **Complexity of the SQL Standard**: The extensive and intricate nature of the SQL standard means that most implementers do not fully support all its features, leading to inconsistencies.\\n  \\n- **Ambiguity in Specifications**: The SQL standard does not provide clear directives on certain critical aspects, such as the behavior of indices and file storage. This ambiguity allows individual implementations to determine their own behavior, resulting in further discrepancies.\\n\\nThese factors contribute to the challenges faced by developers when attempting to migrate SQL code between different database systems, as variations in implementation can lead to significant differences in functionality and behavior.</chunk>\\n<chunk>The SQL standard allows for certain implementation-specific decisions, such as the naming of result columns that are not explicitly defined. While the standard meticulously outlines the syntax that a compliant database system must adhere to, it is less rigorous in specifying the semantics of various language constructs, which can lead to ambiguities in interpretation. \\n\\nSeveral factors contribute to the challenges of SQL portability across different database systems:\\n\\n- **Implementation Variability**: The complexity and breadth of the SQL standard often result in implementers choosing not to support its entirety. This selective adherence can lead to significant differences in functionality.\\n- **Ambiguous Semantics**: The SQL standard's less precise definition of semantics means that different vendors may interpret the same SQL constructs in varying ways, further complicating compatibility.\\n- **Backward Compatibility Concerns**: Many database vendors have established customer bases that rely on the existing behavior of their systems. When newer versions of the SQL standard conflict with prior implementations, vendors may prioritize maintaining backward compatibility over adopting the latest standards.\\n- **Vendor Lock-In**: There is minimal commercial incentive for vendors to facilitate easier transitions between database systems, as this could undermine their customer retention strategies.\\n- **User Priorities**: When evaluating database software, users often prioritize performance and other factors over strict adherence to standards, which can lead to a lack of emphasis on compliance.\\n\\n### Standardization History\\n\\nSQL was officially adopted as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, designated as SQL-86, and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standard is maintained by the ISO/IEC JTC 1, Subcommittee SC 32, which focuses on data management and interchange.\\n\\nFrom its inception until 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) oversaw the certification of SQL database management systems (DBMS) for compliance with the SQL standard. However, the responsibility for compliance certification has since shifted to vendors, who now self-certify their products.\\n\\n### Summary of SQL Standard Revisions\\n\\n| Year | Official Standard | Informal Name | Comments |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1986, 1987 | ANSI X3.135:1986, ISO/IEC 9075:1987 | SQL-86, SQL-87 | First formalization by ANSI |\\n| 1989 | ANSI X3.135-1989, ISO/IEC 9075:1989, FIPS 127-1 | SQL-89 | Minor revision adding integrity constraints, adopted as FIPS 127-1 |\\n| 1992 | ANSI X3.135-1992, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, FIPS 127-2 | SQL-92, SQL2 | Major revision (ISO 9075), introduced _Entry Level_ SQL-92, adopted as FIPS 127-2 |\\n\\nThis structured overview highlights the evolution of SQL standards and the complexities surrounding their implementation, providing a clear context for understanding the challenges of SQL portability and compliance.</chunk>\\n<chunk>In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc., which later became known as Oracle Corporation, recognized the transformative potential of the relational database concepts articulated by pioneers such as Edgar F. Codd, Donald D. Chamberlin, and Raymond F. Boyce. The company aimed to develop a SQL-based Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) with the intention of marketing it to prominent U.S. government entities, including the U.S. Navy and the Central Intelligence Agency. In June 1979, Relational Software launched one of the earliest commercially available SQL implementations, Oracle V2 (Version 2), specifically designed for VAX computers.\\n\\nBy 1986, the standardization of SQL gained significant momentum when the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) officially adopted the \\\"Database Language SQL\\\" definition. This marked the beginning of a series of updates to the standard, with new versions released in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2016, and the most recent iteration in 2023. \\n\\n### Interoperability and Standardization\\n\\nDespite the establishment of these standards, SQL implementations across different vendors often exhibit incompatibilities, leading to variations in syntax and functionality. Key areas of divergence include date and time formatting, string concatenation, handling of `NULL` values, and case sensitivity in comparisons. Notably, while PostgreSQL and Mimer SQL strive for compliance with SQL standards, PostgreSQL does not consistently adhere to all specifications. For instance, PostgreSQL's treatment of unquoted identifiers—converting them to lower case—contrasts with the SQL standard, which dictates that such identifiers should be converted to upper case. Consequently, according to the standard, the identifiers `Foo` and `FOO` should be treated as equivalent, rather than `foo`. \\n\\nThis ongoing challenge of interoperability underscores the complexities faced by developers and database administrators in navigating the diverse landscape of SQL implementations, highlighting the need for continued efforts toward standardization and compatibility in relational database systems.</chunk>\\n<chunk>25. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#cite_ref-professionals_25-0 \\\"Jump up\\\")** Date, Chris J.
