Developed in the 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce, SQL has undergone significant evolution since its initial release in 1986, culminating in the latest version, SQL:2023. \\n\\n**Key Features**  \\n- **File Extension**: .sql  \\n- **Internet Media Type**: application/sql  \\n- **Standardization**: Governed by ISO/IEC 9075  \\n- **Type of Format**: Database  \\n\\n**Sublanguages**  \\nSQL is structured into several sublanguages, each serving a distinct purpose:\\n- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used for querying data.\\n- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used for defining and modifying database structures.\\n- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used for controlling access to data.\\n- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used for managing data within the database.\\n\\n**Evolution of SQL**  \\nSQL has seen various iterations, each introducing new features and enhancements:\\n- SQL-86\\n- SQL-89\\n- SQL-92\\n- SQL:1999\\n- SQL:2003\\n- SQL:2006\\n- SQL:2008\\n- SQL:2011\\n- SQL:2016\\n- SQL:2023\\n\\n**Influence and Dialects**  \\nSQL has influenced numerous other query languages, including:\\n- Contextual Query Language (CQL)\\n- Language Integrated Query (LINQ)\\n- SPARQL\\n- Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)\\n- PowerShell\\n- Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)\\n- jOOQ\\n- N1QL\\n- Graph Query Language (GQL)\\n\\nAdditionally, SQL has various dialects tailored to specific database systems, which may introduce unique syntax or features while adhering to the core principles of SQL.\\n\\n**Challenges and Criticisms**  \\nDespite its widespread adoption, SQL faces challenges related to compliance across different implementations, leading to variations in functionality. Critics have also pointed out SQL's deviations from the relational model, raising questions about its theoretical foundations.\\n\\n**Data Types and Procedural Features**  \\nSQL supports a range of data types and has integrated procedural programming features, allowing for more complex operations and control structures within SQL scripts.\\n\\n**Alternatives to SQL**  \\nWhile SQL remains the dominant language for relational databases, there are alternatives that cater to different data models, such as NoSQL databases, which utilize various query languages tailored to their specific architectures.\\n\\nFor further exploration of SQL, you can refer to resources such as [Wikibooks on Structured Query Language](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language).</chunk>\\n<chunk>Another notable criticism of SQL is its allowance for duplicate rows, which can complicate data integration with programming languages like Python. This challenge arises because Python's data types may not accurately represent SQL data structures, leading to difficulties in parsing and a lack of modularity. To mitigate this issue, SQL provides mechanisms such as primary keys and unique constraints. By designating one or more columns as a primary key, developers can ensure that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable, thereby preventing the occurrence of duplicates.\\n\\n### Impedance Mismatch\\n\\nThe concept of impedance mismatch refers to the discrepancies that arise between the declarative nature of SQL and the procedural languages in which SQL is often embedded. This mismatch can create challenges in data manipulation and retrieval, as the two paradigms operate under different principles and methodologies.\\n\\n## SQL Data Types\\n\\nThe SQL standard categorizes data types into three primary groups, as outlined in chapter 4.1.1 of SQL/Foundation:\\n\\n1. **Predefined Data Types**: These are built-in types that the SQL implementation inherently supports.\\n2. **Constructed Types**: These include complex data structures such as ARRAY, MULTISET, REF (reference), and ROW.\\n3. **User-Defined Types**: Similar to classes in object-oriented programming, these types allow for custom definitions, complete with constructors, methods, and inheritance.\\n\\n### Predefined Data Types\\n\\nPredefined data types in SQL are further divided into several categories:\\n\\n- **Character Types**:\\n  - Character (CHAR)\\n  - Character Varying (VARCHAR)\\n  - Character Large Object (CLOB)\\n\\n- **National Character Types**:\\n  - National Character (NCHAR)\\n  - National Character Varying (NCHAR VARYING)\\n  - National Character Large Object (NCLOB)\\n\\n- **Binary Types**:\\n  - Binary (BINARY)\\n  - Binary Varying (VARBINARY)\\n  - Binary Large Object (BLOB)\\n\\nThese predefined data types provide a foundation for data storage and manipulation within SQL databases, ensuring that various forms of data can be effectively managed and queried.</chunk>\\n<chunk>The SQL standard categorizes data types into several distinct groups, each serving specific purposes within database management. These categories include:\\n\\n### 1. Predefined Data Types\\nPredefined data types are natively supported by SQL implementations and are essential for defining the nature of data stored in a database. They include:\\n\\n- **Character Types**\\n  - **CHAR**: Fixed-length character strings.\\n  - **VARCHAR**: Variable-length character strings.\\n  - **CLOB**: Character large objects for storing large text data.\\n\\n- **National Character Types**\\n  - **NCHAR**: Fixed-length national character strings.\\n  - **NCHAR VARYING**: Variable-length national character strings.\\n  - **NCLOB**: National character large objects.\\n\\n- **Binary Types**\\n  - **BINARY**: Fixed-length binary data.\\n  - **VARBINARY**: Variable-length binary data.\\n  - **BLOB**: Binary large objects for storing large binary data.\\n\\n### 2. Numeric Types\\nNumeric data types are crucial for storing numerical values and are divided into:\\n\\n- **Exact Numeric Types**\\n  - **NUMERIC**: Fixed-point numbers.\\n  - **DECIMAL**: Similar to NUMERIC, used for precise calculations.\\n  - **SMALLINT**: Small integer values.\\n  - **INTEGER**: Standard integer values.\\n  - **BIGINT**: Large integer values.\\n\\n- **Approximate Numeric Types**\\n  - **FLOAT**: Floating-point numbers with approximate precision.\\n  - **REAL**: Single-precision floating-point numbers.\\n  - **DOUBLE PRECISION**: Double-precision floating-point numbers.\\n\\n- **Decimal Floating-Point Type**\\n  - **DECFLOAT**: A type for decimal floating-point numbers.\\n\\n### 3. Temporal Types\\nTemporal data types are used to store date and time information:\\n\\n- **DATE**: Represents calendar dates.\\n- **TIME**: Represents time of day.\\n- **TIMESTAMP**: Combines date and time.\\n- **INTERVAL**: Represents a span of time.\\n\\n### 4. Other Data Types\\nAdditional data types include:\\n\\n- **Boolean**: Represents true or false values.\\n- **XML**: For storing XML data, as defined in SQL/XML specifications.\\n- **JSON**: For storing JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, allowing for flexible data structures.\\n\\n### Related Topics\\nFor further exploration of SQL and its applications, consider the following related topics:\\n\\n- **Object Database**: A database that incorporates object-oriented programming principles.\\n- **List of Relational Database Management Systems**: A comprehensive list of systems that utilize relational database models.\\n- **Comparison of Relational Database Management Systems**: An analysis of various relational database systems and their features.\\n\\nThis structured overview of SQL data types provides a clear understanding of how data is categorized and managed within relational databases, facilitating effective database design and implementation.</chunk>\\n<chunk>### The Concept of Null in SQL\\n\\nThe notion of **Null** in SQL is a topic of considerable debate among database professionals. A Null marker signifies the absence of a value, distinguishing it from a numerical zero in an integer column or an empty string in a text column. This distinction is crucial as it allows for a more nuanced representation of data states. The implementation of Nulls in SQL adheres to **three-valued logic**, which is a specific application of the broader concept of three-valued logic. This logic accommodates the possibilities of true, false, and unknown, thereby enhancing the language's ability to handle incomplete or missing information effectively.\\n\\n### Handling Duplicates in SQL\\n\\nAnother significant aspect of SQL is its treatment of duplicate rows within tables. Critics often highlight that SQL's allowance for duplicates complicates data integration with programming languages like **Python**, where data types may not accurately reflect the underlying database structure. This can lead to challenges in data parsing and a lack of modularity in data handling. To mitigate these issues, SQL provides mechanisms such as **primary keys** and **unique constraints**. By defining one or more columns as a primary key, users can ensure that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable, thereby preventing the occurrence of duplicate entries and enhancing data integrity.\\n\\n### Impedance Mismatch\\n\\nThe concept of **impedance mismatch** arises from the differences between the declarative nature of SQL and the procedural languages in which SQL is often embedded. This mismatch can create challenges when integrating SQL with programming languages, as the two paradigms may not align seamlessly. The result is a potential disconnect that can complicate the development process, requiring developers to navigate the differences in logic and structure between SQL and the host programming language.\\n\\n### SQL Data Types\\n\\nSQL supports a variety of **data types** that allow for the representation of different kinds of information. These data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, dates, and more, each serving specific purposes within database operations. Understanding the available data types is essential for effective database design and query formulation, as they dictate how data is stored, retrieved, and manipulated within the SQL environment. \\n\\nIn summary, the concepts of Null, duplicates, impedance mismatch, and data types are fundamental to understanding SQL's functionality and its application in relational database management systems. Each of these elements plays a critical role in how data is structured, accessed, and maintained, influencing both the design of databases and the development of applications that interact with them.</chunk>\\n<chunk>| **Open Format** | Yes |\\n| **Website** | [ISO Standard 76583](https://www.iso.org/standard/76583.html) |\\n\\n### Structured Query Language (SQL)\\n\\n**Structured Query Language (SQL)** (pronounced /ˌɛsˌkjuˈɛl/ or alternatively as /ˈsiːkwəl/) is a domain-specific language designed for managing and manipulating data within a relational database management system (RDBMS). SQL is particularly adept at handling structured data, which refers to data that is organized in a way that defines relationships among various entities and variables.\\n\\n#### Key Features of SQL:\\n- **Data Management**: SQL provides a robust framework for querying, updating, and managing data stored in relational databases.\\n- **Structured Data Handling**: It excels in working with structured data, allowing users to define and manipulate relationships between different data entities.\\n- **Command Efficiency**: SQL enables users to access multiple records with a single command, streamlining data retrieval and manipulation processes.\\n- **Abstraction of Data Access**: Unlike older APIs, SQL abstracts the underlying data access methods, meaning users do not need to specify how to reach a record, whether through an index or not.\\n\\n#### Historical Context:\\nDeveloped in the 1970s, SQL has undergone significant evolution since its initial release in 1986, culminating in the latest version, SQL:2023. The language has been standardized by organizations such as ANSI and ISO, which has facilitated its widespread adoption across various database systems. Despite its popularity, SQL has faced criticism regarding its divergence from the original relational model, as well as challenges related to compliance and implementation consistency across different platforms.\\n\\n#### Additional Information:\\n- **File Extension**: .sql\\n- **Internet Media Type**: application/sql\\n- **Standard Reference**: ISO/IEC 9075\\n\\nSQL remains a foundational technology in the field of database management, influencing the development of various other query languages and systems.</chunk>\\n  </chunks>\\n</context>\\n\\nImportant: Focus only on the current topic.
