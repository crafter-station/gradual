Foundations and Historical Context of SQL\\n      </unit-title>\\n    </metadata>\\n  </current-topic>\\n  <chunks>\\n    <chunk>The SQL standard allows for certain implementation-specific decisions, such as the naming of result columns that are not explicitly defined. While the standard meticulously outlines the syntax that a compliant database system must adhere to, it is less rigorous in specifying the semantics of various language constructs, which can lead to ambiguities in interpretation. \\n\\nSeveral factors contribute to the challenges of SQL portability across different database systems:\\n\\n- **Implementation Variability**: The complexity and breadth of the SQL standard often result in implementers choosing not to support its entirety. This selective adherence can lead to significant differences in functionality.\\n- **Ambiguous Semantics**: The SQL standard's less precise definition of semantics means that different vendors may interpret the same SQL constructs in varying ways, further complicating compatibility.\\n- **Backward Compatibility Concerns**: Many database vendors have established customer bases that rely on the existing behavior of their systems. When newer versions of the SQL standard conflict with prior implementations, vendors may prioritize maintaining backward compatibility over adopting the latest standards.\\n- **Vendor Lock-In**: There is minimal commercial incentive for vendors to facilitate easier transitions between database systems, as this could undermine their customer retention strategies.\\n- **User Priorities**: When evaluating database software, users often prioritize performance and other factors over strict adherence to standards, which can lead to a lack of emphasis on compliance.\\n\\n### Standardization History\\n\\nSQL was officially adopted as a standard by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, designated as SQL-86, and subsequently by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. The standard is maintained by the ISO/IEC JTC 1, Subcommittee SC 32, which focuses on data management and interchange.\\n\\nFrom its inception until 1996, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) oversaw the certification of SQL database management systems (DBMS) for compliance with the SQL standard. However, the responsibility for compliance certification has since shifted to vendors, who now self-certify their products.\\n\\n### Summary of SQL Standard Revisions\\n\\n| Year | Official Standard | Informal Name | Comments |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| 1986, 1987 | ANSI X3.135:1986, ISO/IEC 9075:1987 | SQL-86, SQL-87 | First formalization by ANSI |\\n| 1989 | ANSI X3.135-1989, ISO/IEC 9075:1989, FIPS 127-1 | SQL-89 | Minor revision adding integrity constraints, adopted as FIPS 127-1 |\\n| 1992 | ANSI X3.135-1992, ISO/IEC 9075:1992, FIPS 127-2 | SQL-92, SQL2 | Major revision (ISO 9075), introduced _Entry Level_ SQL-92, adopted as FIPS 127-2 |\\n\\nThis structured overview highlights the evolution of SQL standards and the complexities surrounding their implementation, providing a clear context for understanding the challenges of SQL portability and compliance.</chunk>\\n<chunk>SQL implementations exhibit significant incompatibilities across different vendors, often failing to adhere fully to established standards. Key areas of divergence include the syntax for date and time, string concatenation methods, handling of `NULL` values, and the case sensitivity of comparisons. For instance, while both PostgreSQL and Mimer SQL aim for compliance with SQL standards, PostgreSQL does not consistently follow the standard in all aspects. A notable example is its treatment of unquoted identifiers; PostgreSQL converts them to lower case, contrary to the SQL standard, which dictates that unquoted names should be converted to upper case. Therefore, according to the standard, the identifiers `Foo` and `FOO` should be treated as equivalent, while PostgreSQL interprets `Foo` as distinct from `FOO` and `foo`.\\n\\nThis lack of uniformity in SQL implementations can lead to challenges in code portability between different database systems. As a result, developers often need to modify SQL code to accommodate the specific syntax and behavior of the target database management system (DBMS). The complexity and breadth of the SQL standard contribute to this issue, as many implementers choose not to support the entire standard. Additionally, the SQL standard does not provide explicit guidelines for certain critical areas, such as indexing and file storage, leaving it to individual implementations to determine their behavior. This further exacerbates the inconsistencies observed across various SQL platforms.</chunk>\\n<chunk>### Timeline of SQL Language Standards\\n\\nThe SQL language has undergone significant evolution since its inception, with various standards established over the years. The current standard is typically referenced using the format: **ISO/IEC 9075-n:yyyy Part n: title**. For convenience, it is often abbreviated as **ISO/IEC 9075**. Interested parties can acquire the official standards documents from organizations such as ISO, IEC, or ANSI, while some earlier drafts may be available for free.\\n\\n**Complementary Standards**  \\nIn addition to the main SQL standard, **ISO/IEC 9075** is supported by **ISO/IEC 13249**, which focuses on SQL Multimedia and Application Packages, along with several technical reports that provide further guidance and specifications.\\n\\n### Current SQL Standards Overview\\n\\n| Year | Standard Reference | Title | Key Features |\\n|------|--------------------|-------|--------------|\\n| 2011 | ISO/IEC 9075:2011  | [SQL:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011 \\\"SQL:2011\\\") | Introduced temporal data (PERIOD FOR), enhancements for window functions, and the FETCH clause. |\\n| 2016 | ISO/IEC 9075:2016  | [SQL:2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016 \\\"SQL:2016\\\") | Added row pattern matching, polymorphic table functions, and operations for JSON data stored in character string fields. |\\n| 2019 | ISO/IEC 9075-15:2019 | [SQL:2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SQL:2019&action=edit&redlink=1 \\\"SQL:2019 (page does not exist)\\\") | Introduced Part 15, which includes multidimensional arrays (MDarray type and operators). |\\n| 2023 | ISO/IEC 9075:2023  | [SQL:2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2023 \\\"SQL:2023\\\") | Added JSON data type (SQL/Foundation) and introduced Part 16, which covers Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ). |\\n\\n### SQL Syntax Overview\\n\\nFor a comprehensive understanding of SQL syntax, refer to the main article on [SQL syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax \\\"SQL syntax\\\"). SQL syntax encompasses the rules and structure for writing SQL statements, which are essential for interacting with relational databases effectively. \\n\\nThis timeline and overview provide a clear understanding of the evolution and current state of SQL standards, highlighting the key features introduced in each version while maintaining the integrity of the information for independent comprehension.</chunk>\\n<chunk>25. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL#cite_ref-professionals_25-0 \\\"Jump up\\\")** Date, Chris J.

This article critically examines the current status of SQL as a standardized language, discussing the implications of various implementations and the challenges faced in maintaining compliance with the original relational model.</chunk>\\n<chunk>In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc., which later became known as Oracle Corporation, recognized the transformative potential of the relational database concepts articulated by pioneers such as Edgar F. Codd, Donald D. Chamberlin, and Raymond F. Boyce. The company aimed to develop a SQL-based Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) with the intention of marketing it to prominent U.S. government entities, including the U.S. Navy and the Central Intelligence Agency. In June 1979, Relational Software launched one of the earliest commercially available SQL implementations, Oracle V2 (Version 2), specifically designed for VAX computers.\\n\\nBy 1986, the standardization of SQL gained significant momentum when the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) officially adopted the \\\"Database Language SQL\\\" definition. This marked the beginning of a series of updates to the standard, with new versions released in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2016, and the most recent iteration in 2023. \\n\\n### Interoperability and Standardization\\n\\nDespite the establishment of these standards, SQL implementations across different vendors often exhibit incompatibilities, leading to variations in syntax and functionality. Key areas of divergence include date and time formatting, string concatenation, handling of `NULL` values, and case sensitivity in comparisons. Notably, while PostgreSQL and Mimer SQL strive for compliance with SQL standards, PostgreSQL does not consistently adhere to all specifications. For instance, PostgreSQL's treatment of unquoted identifiersâ€”converting them to lower caseâ€”contrasts with the SQL standard, which dictates that such identifiers should be converted to upper case. Consequently, according to the standard, the identifiers `Foo` and `FOO` should be treated as equivalent, rather than `foo`. \\n\\nThis ongoing challenge of interoperability underscores the complexities faced by developers and database administrators in navigating the diverse landscape of SQL implementations, highlighting the need for continued efforts toward standardization and compatibility in relational database systems.</chunk>\\n  </chunks>\\n</context>\\n\\nImportant: Focus only on the current topic.
