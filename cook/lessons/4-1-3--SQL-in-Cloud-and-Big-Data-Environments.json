Below is a list of notable alternatives to SQL, focusing on those that maintain a relational approach:\\n\\n- **.QL**: An object-oriented query language based on Datalog principles.\\n- **4D Query Language (4D QL)**: A query language used in the 4th Dimension database management system.\\n- **Datalog**: This language is often praised for its cleaner semantics, which enhance program understanding and maintenance. It is also considered more expressive, particularly for recursive queries.\\n- **HTSQL**: A URL-based query language that allows users to construct queries through web-friendly syntax.\\n- **IBM Business System 12 (IBM BS12)**: One of the earliest fully relational database management systems, introduced in 1982.\\n- **ISBL**: A language designed for database manipulation.\\n- **jOOQ**: A Java-based internal domain-specific language that allows SQL to be implemented in Java applications.\\n- **Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)**: The query language utilized by the Java Persistence API and the Hibernate persistence library.\\n- **JavaScript**: MongoDB employs a query language that is implemented through a JavaScript API.\\n- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: A feature of .NET that allows SQL-like queries to be written directly within .NET code.\\n- **Object Query Language**: A query language designed for querying object databases.\\n- **QBE (Query By Example)**: Developed by Moshè Zloof at IBM in 1977, this approach allows users to construct queries by providing examples of the desired output.\\n- **QUEL**: Introduced in 1974 by the U.C. Berkeley Ingres project, QUEL is closer to tuple relational calculus than SQL.\\n- **XQuery**: A functional query language designed to query XML data.\\n\\n## Distributed SQL Processing\\n\\nThe **Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA)** was developed by a collaborative IBM workgroup between 1988 and 1994. This architecture facilitates the interaction of network-connected relational databases, enabling them to work together to process SQL requests efficiently.\\n\\nIn a distributed environment, users or applications can issue SQL statements to a local relational database (RDB) and receive data tables and status indicators from remote RDBs. Additionally, SQL statements can be compiled and stored as packages in remote RDBs, allowing them to be invoked by name. This capability is crucial for optimizing the performance of applications that require complex and frequent queries, especially when accessing tables located in remote systems. \\n\\n## Criticisms of SQL\\n\\nDespite its widespread use, SQL has faced criticism for its deviations from the theoretical foundations of the relational model, particularly in its implementation of tuple calculus. In the relational model, a table is defined as a set of tuples, whereas SQL treats tables and query results as ordered lists of rows. This distinction allows for the same row to appear multiple times and enables the use of row order in queries, such as in the LIMIT clause. These differences have raised concerns about SQL's adherence to the principles of relational theory.</chunk>\\n<chunk>### Structured Query Language (SQL)\\n\\n**Overview**  \\nStructured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific programming language designed for managing and manipulating data within relational database management systems (RDBMS). Developed in the 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F.

Critics have also pointed out SQL's deviations from the relational model, raising questions about its theoretical foundations.\\n\\n**Data Types and Procedural Features**  \\nSQL supports a range of data types and has integrated procedural programming features, allowing for more complex operations and control structures within SQL scripts.\\n\\n**Alternatives to SQL**  \\nWhile SQL remains the dominant language for relational databases, there are alternatives that cater to different data models, such as NoSQL databases, which utilize various query languages tailored to their specific architectures.\\n\\nFor further exploration of SQL, you can refer to resources such as [Wikibooks on Structured Query Language](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language).</chunk>\\n<chunk>The document provides a comprehensive overview of SQL (Structured Query Language), a pivotal programming language for relational databases that was developed in the 1970s by Donald D.

It also mentions alternatives to SQL, providing a broader context within the landscape of database management systems.\\n\\nIn summary, this document serves as a detailed resource for understanding SQL's historical development, structural components, standardization efforts, and its role in the evolution of database technologies.</chunk>\\n<chunk>**Overview of SQL (Structured Query Language)**\\n\\nSQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful relational database programming language that was developed in the 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. Initially released in 1986, SQL has undergone significant evolution, culminating in its latest version, SQL:2023, which was released in June 2023. This language has various dialects and has significantly influenced the development of other query languages.\\n\\n**Key Features and Structure**\\n\\nSQL is structured around several sublanguages, each serving a distinct purpose:\\n- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used for querying data.\\n- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used for defining and managing database structures.\\n- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used for controlling access to data.\\n- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used for manipulating data within the database.\\n\\nThe foundation of SQL is rooted in relational algebra, which provides the theoretical basis for its operations. \\n\\n**Standardization and Compliance**\\n\\nThe standardization of SQL has been overseen by organizations such as ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Despite these efforts, compliance with SQL standards can vary across different database implementations, leading to challenges in interoperability. Additionally, SQL has faced criticism for straying from the principles of the relational model, which can impact its effectiveness in certain applications.\\n\\n**Data Types and Components**\\n\\nSQL supports a variety of data types, allowing for the representation of different kinds of information. Key components of SQL include:\\n- **Tables**: The primary structure for storing data.\\n- **Indexes**: Used to improve the speed of data retrieval.\\n- **Views**: Virtual tables that provide a way to present data in a specific format.\\n\\nMoreover, SQL has integrated procedural programming features, enhancing its capabilities for complex data manipulation and processing.\\n\\n**Alternatives and Related Topics**\\n\\nWhile SQL remains the dominant language for relational database management systems, there are alternatives available, such as NoSQL databases, which cater to different data storage and retrieval needs. The landscape of database management continues to evolve, with ongoing discussions about the future of SQL and its role in modern data management practices.\\n\\n**Additional Information**\\n\\n- **Paradigm**: Declarative\\n- **Family**: Query language\\n- **Typing Discipline**: Static and strong typing\\n\\n**Historical Context**\\n\\n- **First Appeared**: 1974\\n- **Stable Release**: SQL:2023 (June 2023)\\n\\nThis overview encapsulates the essential aspects of SQL, providing a comprehensive understanding of its significance in the realm of database management.</chunk>\\n  </chunks>\\n</context>\\n\\nImportant: Focus only on the current topic.
