Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. SQL has undergone significant evolution since its initial release in 1986, culminating in the latest version, SQL:2023. This language has various dialects and has significantly influenced the development of other query languages.\\n\\n#### Key Components of SQL\\n\\nSQL is structured around several sublanguages, each serving a distinct purpose:\\n\\n- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used for querying data.\\n- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used for defining and managing database structures.\\n- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used for controlling access to data.\\n- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used for manipulating data within the database.\\n\\nThe foundation of SQL is rooted in **relational algebra**, which provides the theoretical basis for its operations.\\n\\n#### Standardization and Compliance\\n\\nThe standardization of SQL has been overseen by organizations such as ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization). However, compliance with these standards can be challenging due to variations in implementation across different database systems. Critics have pointed out that SQL sometimes deviates from the original relational model, raising concerns about its adherence to theoretical principles.\\n\\n#### Data Types and Procedural Features\\n\\nSQL supports a variety of data types, which are essential for defining the nature of data stored in databases. Additionally, SQL has integrated procedural programming features, allowing for more complex operations and control structures within database queries.\\n\\n#### Alternatives to SQL\\n\\nWhile SQL remains the dominant language for relational database management systems, there are several alternatives available. These alternatives cater to different needs and preferences in database management, reflecting the diverse landscape of data handling technologies.\\n\\n### Related Standards and Frameworks\\n\\nThe following standards and frameworks are relevant to the broader context of database management and multimedia integration:\\n\\n- **ISO 14617**: A standard for graphical symbols for diagrams.\\n- **ISO 14644**: A standard for cleanrooms and controlled environments.\\n- **ISO 14971**: A standard for the application of risk management to medical devices.\\n- **ISO 15189**: A standard for medical laboratories.\\n- **ISO/IEC 15288**: A standard for systems engineering.\\n\\n#### Multimedia Standards\\n\\nIn addition to database standards, various multimedia standards are also significant:\\n\\n- **Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework**: A framework for integrating multimedia delivery.\\n- **Advanced Video Coding (H.264)**: A standard for video compression.\\n- **MPEG-4**: A standard for coding audio-visual objects.\\n\\nThese standards play a crucial role in ensuring interoperability and quality in multimedia applications.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis refined text provides a comprehensive overview of SQL, its components, standardization, and related multimedia standards, ensuring clarity and independence for each section.</chunk>\\n  </chunks>\\n</context>\\n\\nImportant: Focus only on the current topic.
