Query optimization involves analyzing and improving SQL queries to reduce execution time and resource usage. Indexing, on the other hand, is a technique that improves data retrieval speed by creating special lookup tables. \n\nKey topics include:\n- How query execution plans work\n- The role of indexes in speeding up queries\n- Basic terminology: cost, selectivity, and index types\n\nLet's begin by understanding these foundational concepts."

Place the most frequently queried or filtered column first.\n- **Over-indexing:** Too many indexes can slow down write operations.\n\nHereâ€™s an example of creating a composite index:\n\n```sql\nCREATE INDEX idx_customer_name ON customers(last_name, first_name);\n```\n\nThis index helps optimize queries that filter on both `last_name` and `first_name`."
