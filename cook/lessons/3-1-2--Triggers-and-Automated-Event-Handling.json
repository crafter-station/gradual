        "body": "In this step, we introduce **triggers** as automated responses to database events. A trigger is a database object that automatically executes a specified procedure when certain events (like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE) occur. This mechanism ensures that business rules and data integrity constraints are enforced without requiring manual intervention.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Triggers automate event handling in the database.\n- They are often used to enforce business rules and maintain consistency.\n- Basic syntax involves specifying the event and the action to perform."
