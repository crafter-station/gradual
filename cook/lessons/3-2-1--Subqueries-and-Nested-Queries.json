Subqueries allow you to break complex queries into simpler parts and modularize your logic. Typically, they are used in `WHERE`, `FROM`, or `SELECT` clauses. \n\nExample syntax in a WHERE clause:\n\n```sql\nSELECT employee_id, name\nFROM employees\nWHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales');\n```\n\nThis query retrieves employees working in the Sales department."
