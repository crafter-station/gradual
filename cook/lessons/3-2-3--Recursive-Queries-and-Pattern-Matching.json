A recursive CTE typically consists of two parts:\n\n- **Anchor member**: The base case that retrieves the initial dataset.\n- **Recursive member**: The part that references the CTE itself to build upon the anchor data.\n\nHere's the basic structure:\n\n```sql\nWITH RECURSIVE cte_name AS (\n    -- Anchor member\n    SELECT ...\n    FROM table\n    WHERE condition\n\n    UNION ALL\n\n    -- Recursive member\n    SELECT ...\n    FROM table\n    JOIN cte_name ON join_condition\n)\nSELECT * FROM cte_name;\n```"

Sometimes you need to extract hierarchical data and then apply filters based on textual patterns.
