Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s. Their work was heavily influenced by the relational model proposed by Edgar F. Codd. The first iteration of this language was originally named SEQUEL, which stood for Structured English Query Language. It was specifically designed to facilitate the manipulation and retrieval of data within IBM's pioneering quasirelational database management system known as System R. This system was developed by a dedicated team at the IBM San Jose Research Laboratory during the 1970s.\\n\\nThe evolution of SQL from SEQUEL to its current form reflects significant advancements in database technology and the growing need for efficient data management solutions. The language was tailored to meet the requirements of users seeking a more intuitive way to interact with databases, ultimately leading to its widespread adoption across various platforms and systems.</chunk>\\n<chunk>Chamberlin and Boyce's initial foray into creating a relational database language was marked by the development of SQUARE (Specifying Queries in A Relational Environment). However, this early attempt faced usability challenges due to its reliance on subscript and superscript notation, which complicated the user experience. In 1973, after relocating to the San Jose Research Laboratory, they embarked on a new project intended as a successor to SQUARE. The original name, SEQUEL, was playfully derived as a pun on QUEL, the query language used by Ingres. However, the name was later modified to SQL (Structured Query Language) after it was discovered that \\\"SEQUEL\\\" was a trademark owned by the UK-based Hawker Siddeley Dynamics Engineering Limited company.\\n\\nFollowing the development of SQL, IBM conducted extensive testing at customer sites to evaluate the language's practicality and effectiveness. This led to the creation of commercial products based on their System R prototype, which included notable systems such as System/38, SQL/DS, and IBM Db2. These products were released to the market in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively, marking significant milestones in the commercial adoption of SQL and relational database technology.</chunk>\\n<chunk>- **Oral History Interview with Donald D. Chamberlin**: This interview, hosted by the [Charles Babbage Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage_Institute), features Donald D. Chamberlin discussing his formative years, educational background at [Harvey Mudd College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Mudd_College) and [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University), as well as his pivotal role in the development of relational database technology. As a key member of the System R research team, Chamberlin, alongside [Raymond F. Boyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_F._Boyce), was instrumental in creating the SQL database language. The interview also touches on his recent research endeavors related to XML query languages.\\n\\n- **SQL Versions**: The evolution of SQL is marked by several significant versions, each introducing new features and enhancements. The timeline of SQL versions includes:\\n  - [SEQUEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEQUEL): The original name for SQL.\\n  - [SQL-86](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SQL-86&action=edit&redlink=1): The first standardized version of SQL.\\n  - [SQL-89](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SQL-89&action=edit&redlink=1): An update to SQL-86 with minor enhancements.\\n  - [SQL-92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92): A major revision that introduced significant features.\\n  - [SQL:1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:1999): Added support for object-oriented features and triggers.\\n  - [SQL:2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2003): Introduced XML-related features and window functions.\\n  - [SQL:2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2006): Focused on XML enhancements.\\n  - [SQL:2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2008): Included additional features for improved performance and usability.\\n  - [SQL:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011): Introduced temporal data support.\\n  - [SQL:2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016): Enhanced JSON support and other features.\\n  - [SQL:2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2023): The latest version, continuing the evolution of SQL.\\n\\nThis structured overview provides a comprehensive understanding of SQL's historical context and its ongoing development, highlighting the contributions of key figures and the significance of each version in the language's evolution.</chunk>\\n<chunk>The document provides a comprehensive overview of SQL (Structured Query Language), a pivotal programming language for relational databases that was developed in the 1970s by Donald D.
