These sublanguages include:\\n\\n- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used for querying and retrieving data from databases.\\n- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Focuses on the creation and modification of database schemas, including tables and relationships.\\n- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Manages permissions and access controls for database users.\\n- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Facilitates the manipulation of data within the database, allowing for operations such as insertion, updating, and deletion of records.\\n\\nThe comprehensive scope of SQL extends beyond mere data retrieval; it encompasses data manipulation, schema definition, and access control. While SQL is fundamentally a declarative language, often classified as a fourth-generation language (4GL), it also integrates procedural programming elements, enabling users to write complex scripts and functions that enhance its functionality. This combination of declarative and procedural capabilities allows for a robust and flexible approach to database management, catering to a wide range of application needs.</chunk>\\n  </chunks>\\n</context>\\n\\nImportant: Focus only on the current topic.
