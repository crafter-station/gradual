Boyce, SQL has undergone significant evolution since its initial release in 1986, culminating in the latest version, SQL:2023. \\n\\n**Key Features**  \\n- **File Extension**: .sql  \\n- **Internet Media Type**: application/sql  \\n- **Standardization**: Governed by ISO/IEC 9075  \\n- **Type of Format**: Database  \\n\\n**Sublanguages**  \\nSQL is structured into several sublanguages, each serving a distinct purpose:\\n- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used for querying data.\\n- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used for defining and modifying database structures.\\n- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used for controlling access to data.\\n- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used for managing data within the database.\\n\\n**Evolution of SQL**  \\nSQL has seen various iterations, each introducing new features and enhancements:\\n- SQL-86\\n- SQL-89\\n- SQL-92\\n- SQL:1999\\n- SQL:2003\\n- SQL:2006\\n- SQL:2008\\n- SQL:2011\\n- SQL:2016\\n- SQL:2023\\n\\n**Influence and Dialects**  \\nSQL has influenced numerous other query languages, including:\\n- Contextual Query Language (CQL)\\n- Language Integrated Query (LINQ)\\n- SPARQL\\n- Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)\\n- PowerShell\\n- Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)\\n- jOOQ\\n- N1QL\\n- Graph Query Language (GQL)\\n\\nAdditionally, SQL has various dialects tailored to specific database systems, which may introduce unique syntax or features while adhering to the core principles of SQL.\\n\\n**Challenges and Criticisms**  \\nDespite its widespread adoption, SQL faces challenges related to compliance across different implementations, leading to variations in functionality. Critics have also pointed out SQL's deviations from the relational model, raising questions about its theoretical foundations.\\n\\n**Data Types and Procedural Features**  \\nSQL supports a range of data types and has integrated procedural programming features, allowing for more complex operations and control structures within SQL scripts.\\n\\n**Alternatives to SQL**  \\nWhile SQL remains the dominant language for relational databases, there are alternatives that cater to different data models, such as NoSQL databases, which utilize various query languages tailored to their specific architectures.\\n\\nFor further exploration of SQL, you can refer to resources such as [Wikibooks on Structured Query Language](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structured_Query_Language).</chunk>\\n<chunk>## Alternatives to SQL\\n\\nWhen discussing alternatives to SQL, it is essential to differentiate between alternatives to the SQL language itself and alternatives to the relational model as a whole. Below are notable alternatives that propose different approaches to querying and managing data within relational frameworks. For alternatives to the relational model, consider exploring navigational databases and NoSQL systems.\\n\\n### Proposed Relational Alternatives to SQL\\n\\n- **.QL**: An object-oriented query language based on Datalog, which emphasizes a more structured approach to data retrieval.\\n- **4D Query Language (4D QL)**: A query language designed for the 4th Dimension database management system, focusing on ease of use and integration with its development environment.\\n- **Datalog**: A declarative logic programming language that critics argue offers cleaner semantics than SQL, enhancing program understanding and maintenance. It is particularly noted for its expressiveness in handling recursive queries.\\n- **HTSQL**: A URL-based query language that allows users to construct queries through web-friendly syntax, facilitating integration with web applications.\\n- **IBM Business System 12 (IBM BS12)**: One of the earliest fully relational database management systems, introduced in 1982, which laid foundational principles for relational database design.\\n- **ISBL**: A programming language designed for database management, providing an alternative syntax and structure for data manipulation.\\n- **jOOQ**: A Java-based internal domain-specific language that allows developers to write SQL queries in a type-safe manner, integrating seamlessly with Java applications.\\n- **Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)**: The query language utilized by the Java Persistence API and Hibernate, enabling developers to perform database operations using object-oriented paradigms.\\n\\nThese alternatives reflect the ongoing evolution of database technologies and the diverse needs of developers and organizations in managing data effectively. Each option presents unique features and advantages, catering to different use cases and preferences in database management.</chunk>\\n<chunk>**Overview of SQL (Structured Query Language)**\\n\\nSQL, or Structured Query Language, is a powerful relational database programming language that was developed in the 1970s by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. Initially released in 1986, SQL has undergone significant evolution, culminating in its latest version, SQL:2023, which was released in June 2023. This language has various dialects and has significantly influenced the development of other query languages.\\n\\n**Key Features and Structure**\\n\\nSQL is structured around several sublanguages, each serving a distinct purpose:\\n- **Data Query Language (DQL)**: Used for querying data.\\n- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Used for defining and managing database structures.\\n- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Used for controlling access to data.\\n- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Used for manipulating data within the database.\\n\\nThe foundation of SQL is rooted in relational algebra, which provides the theoretical basis for its operations. \\n\\n**Standardization and Compliance**\\n\\nThe standardization of SQL has been overseen by organizations such as ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Despite these efforts, compliance with SQL standards can vary across different database implementations, leading to challenges in interoperability. Additionally, SQL has faced criticism for straying from the principles of the relational model, which can impact its effectiveness in certain applications.\\n\\n**Data Types and Components**\\n\\nSQL supports a variety of data types, allowing for the representation of different kinds of information. Key components of SQL include:\\n- **Tables**: The primary structure for storing data.\\n- **Indexes**: Used to improve the speed of data retrieval.\\n- **Views**: Virtual tables that provide a way to present data in a specific format.\\n\\nMoreover, SQL has integrated procedural programming features, enhancing its capabilities for complex data manipulation and processing.\\n\\n**Alternatives and Related Topics**\\n\\nWhile SQL remains the dominant language for relational database management systems, there are alternatives available, such as NoSQL databases, which cater to different data storage and retrieval needs. The landscape of database management continues to evolve, with ongoing discussions about the future of SQL and its role in modern data management practices.\\n\\n**Additional Information**\\n\\n- **Paradigm**: Declarative\\n- **Family**: Query language\\n- **Typing Discipline**: Static and strong typing\\n\\n**Historical Context**\\n\\n- **First Appeared**: 1974\\n- **Stable Release**: SQL:2023 (June 2023)\\n\\nThis overview encapsulates the essential aspects of SQL, providing a comprehensive understanding of its significance in the realm of database management.</chunk>\\n  </chunks>\\n</context>\\n\\nImportant: Focus only on the current topic.
