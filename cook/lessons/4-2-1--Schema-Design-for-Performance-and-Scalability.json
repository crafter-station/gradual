Consider the following SQL snippet for partitioning a table:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE Orders (\n  OrderID INT,\n  OrderDate DATE,\n  CustomerID INT,\n  OrderAmount DECIMAL(10, 2)\n) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(OrderDate)) (\n  PARTITION p2019 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),\n  PARTITION p2020 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),\n  PARTITION p2021 VALUES LESS THAN (2022)\n);\n```\n\nThis approach helps the database engine focus on only the necessary data segments during queries."

Continue alternating between tutorials, examples, and questions\\n\\nRequired step count: 10-15 steps total\\n\\nExample pattern of steps:\\nTUTORIAL (introduce foundational concept)\\nEXAMPLE (demonstrate foundational concept)\\nQUESTION (test foundational concept)\\nQUESTION (reinforce foundational concept)\\nTUTORIAL (introduce intermediate concept)\\nEXAMPLE (demonstrate intermediate concept)\\nQUESTION (test intermediate concept)\\nQUESTION (reinforce intermediate concept)\\nEXAMPLE (demonstrate advanced application)\\nQUESTION (test advanced application)\\nTUTORIAL (deeper concept)\\nQUESTION (comprehensive application)\\n... continues\\n\\nGuidelines:\\n- Use markdown formatting in the content\\n- Make the progression logical and build upon previous knowledge\\n- Include code examples when relevant\\n- For questions, provide meaningful explanations for each alternative\\n- Stay focused on the specific topic scope\\n- Avoid covering material from other modules\\n\\nEach step must follow one of these formats:\\n\\nTUTORIAL steps should:\\n- Start with foundational concepts\\n- Use clear explanations with markdown formatting\\n- Include relevant code snippets or diagrams when needed\\n- Break down complex topics into digestible parts\\n- Format content as:\\n  {\\n    type: \\\"TUTORIAL\\\",\\n    title: \\\"Clear, concise title\\\",\\n    body: \\\"Detailed explanation in markdown\\\"\\n  }\\n\\nEXAMPLE steps should:\\n- Demonstrate practical applications\\n- Show real-world scenarios\\n- Include both the problem and its solution\\n- Explain the reasoning behind the solution\\n- Format content as:\\n  {\\n    type: \\\"EXAMPLE\\\",\\n    body: \\\"Problem description\\\",\\n    answer: \\\"Detailed solution\\\"\\n  }\\n\\nQUESTION steps should:\\n- Test understanding of previously covered concepts\\n- Have 3-4 carefully crafted alternatives\\n- Include detailed explanations for each alternative\\n- Ensure the correct alternative is clearly superior\\n- Format content as:\\n  {\\n    type: \\\"QUESTION\\\",\\n    question: \\\"Clear question text\\\",\\n    alternatives: [\\n      {\\n        order: 1,\\n        content: \\\"Alternative text\\\",\\n        explanation: \\\"Why this is/isn't correct\\\"\\n      },\\n      // ... more alternatives\\n    ],\\n    correctAlternativeOrder: number\\n  }\\n\\n<reminder>\\n  <topic-scope>\\n    Focus only on the current topic.
