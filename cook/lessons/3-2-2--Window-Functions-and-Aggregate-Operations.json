This is similar to the way aggregate functions work, but window functions do not reduce the number of rows returned. \n\nKey concepts include:\n- **Partitioning**: Dividing the data into groups\n- **Ordering**: Defining the sequence of rows within each partition\n- **Window frame**: Specifying the set of rows for calculation\n\nConsider this simple code snippet:\n\n```sql\nSELECT employee_id, department, salary,\n       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dept_rank\nFROM employees;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `RANK()` function ranks employees within each department based on their salary."

They are useful in scenarios where you need an ordered list within partitions.\n\nExample snippet for a moving average:\n\n```sql\nSELECT date, sales,\n       AVG(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg\nFROM daily_sales;\n```\n\nThis calculates a moving average for each row considering the current day and the two preceding days."
