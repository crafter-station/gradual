The current standard is typically referenced using the format: **ISO/IEC 9075-n:yyyy Part n: title**. For convenience, it is often abbreviated as **ISO/IEC 9075**. Interested parties can acquire the official standards documents from organizations such as ISO, IEC, or ANSI, while some earlier drafts may be available for free.\\n\\n**Complementary Standards**  \\nIn addition to the main SQL standard, **ISO/IEC 9075** is supported by **ISO/IEC 13249**, which focuses on SQL Multimedia and Application Packages, along with several technical reports that provide further guidance and specifications.\\n\\n### Current SQL Standards Overview\\n\\n| Year | Standard Reference | Title | Key Features |\\n|------|--------------------|-------|--------------|\\n| 2011 | ISO/IEC 9075:2011  | [SQL:2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2011 \\\"SQL:2011\\\") | Introduced temporal data (PERIOD FOR), enhancements for window functions, and the FETCH clause. |\\n| 2016 | ISO/IEC 9075:2016  | [SQL:2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016 \\\"SQL:2016\\\") | Added row pattern matching, polymorphic table functions, and operations for JSON data stored in character string fields. |\\n| 2019 | ISO/IEC 9075-15:2019 | [SQL:2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SQL:2019&action=edit&redlink=1 \\\"SQL:2019 (page does not exist)\\\") | Introduced Part 15, which includes multidimensional arrays (MDarray type and operators). |\\n| 2023 | ISO/IEC 9075:2023  | [SQL:2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2023 \\\"SQL:2023\\\") | Added JSON data type (SQL/Foundation) and introduced Part 16, which covers Property Graph Queries (SQL/PGQ). |\\n\\n### SQL Syntax Overview\\n\\nFor a comprehensive understanding of SQL syntax, refer to the main article on [SQL syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax \\\"SQL syntax\\\").
