Below is a list of notable alternatives to SQL, focusing on those that maintain a relational approach:\\n\\n- **.QL**: An object-oriented query language based on Datalog principles.\\n- **4D Query Language (4D QL)**: A query language used in the 4th Dimension database management system.\\n- **Datalog**: This language is often praised for its cleaner semantics, which enhance program understanding and maintenance. It is also considered more expressive, particularly for recursive queries.\\n- **HTSQL**: A URL-based query language that allows users to construct queries through web-friendly syntax.\\n- **IBM Business System 12 (IBM BS12)**: One of the earliest fully relational database management systems, introduced in 1982.\\n- **ISBL**: A language designed for database manipulation.\\n- **jOOQ**: A Java-based internal domain-specific language that allows SQL to be implemented in Java applications.\\n- **Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL)**: The query language utilized by the Java Persistence API and the Hibernate persistence library.\\n- **JavaScript**: MongoDB employs a query language that is implemented through a JavaScript API.\\n- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: A feature of .NET that allows SQL-like queries to be written directly within .NET code.\\n- **Object Query Language**: A query language designed for querying object databases.\\n- **QBE (Query By Example)**: Developed by Moshè Zloof at IBM in 1977, this approach allows users to construct queries by providing examples of the desired output.\\n- **QUEL**: Introduced in 1974 by the U.C. Berkeley Ingres project, QUEL is closer to tuple relational calculus than SQL.\\n- **XQuery**: A functional query language designed to query XML data.\\n\\n## Distributed SQL Processing\\n\\nThe **Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA)** was developed by a collaborative IBM workgroup between 1988 and 1994. This architecture facilitates the interaction of network-connected relational databases, enabling them to work together to process SQL requests efficiently.\\n\\nIn a distributed environment, users or applications can issue SQL statements to a local relational database (RDB) and receive data tables and status indicators from remote RDBs. Additionally, SQL statements can be compiled and stored as packages in remote RDBs, allowing them to be invoked by name. This capability is crucial for optimizing the performance of applications that require complex and frequent queries, especially when accessing tables located in remote systems. \\n\\n## Criticisms of SQL\\n\\nDespite its widespread use, SQL has faced criticism for its deviations from the theoretical foundations of the relational model, particularly in its implementation of tuple calculus. In the relational model, a table is defined as a set of tuples, whereas SQL treats tables and query results as ordered lists of rows. This distinction allows for the same row to appear multiple times and enables the use of row order in queries, such as in the LIMIT clause. These differences have raised concerns about SQL's adherence to the principles of relational theory.</chunk>\\n  </chunks>\\n</context>\\n\\nImportant: Focus only on the current topic.
