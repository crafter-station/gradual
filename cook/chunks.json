Among the earliest known works is the _Bakhshali Manuscript_, composed in India during the 7th century AD, which presented an algebraic formula for solving quadratic equations alongside linear indeterminate equations. Following this, the 9th-century mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi made notable advancements by developing a comprehensive set of formulas that addressed positive solutions to quadratic equations. Al-Khwarizmi's work laid the groundwork for a complete solution to the general quadratic equation, acknowledging that each quadratic could yield one or two numerical answers, and he also incorporated geometric interpretations into his methods.\n\nIn his explorations, al-Khwarizmi introduced the technique of completing the square, a pivotal method for solving quadratic equations. He emphasized the importance of the discriminant, a critical component in determining the nature of the roots. Specifically, he noted that for a quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be positive. This concept was further validated by his contemporary, 'Abd al-Hamīd ibn Turk, who provided geometric proofs to illustrate that a positive discriminant correlates with the existence of real solutions.\n\nWhile al-Khwarizmi initially did not accept negative solutions, subsequent Islamic mathematicians expanded upon his work by embracing both negative and irrational numbers as valid solutions to quadratic equations. This evolution in thought marked a significant shift in the understanding of quadratic equations, allowing for a broader range of solutions and applications in various fields, including physics and engineering.
